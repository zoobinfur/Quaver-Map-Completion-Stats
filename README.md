# Quaver-Map-Completion-Stats
A tool to measure how many ranked maps a player has completed in Quaver.

- Provides an overall completion percentage statisitc and statitistics for different difficulty ranges.
- Gives the names of maps which stop a difficulty range from being 100% complete (hopefully useful for completionists).
- Uses the Quaver API (v2) to retrieve both maps and scores. The API has a ratelimit of 100 requests per minute, which means the program currently takes ~1 hour to complete.

+ 7k coming soon.
